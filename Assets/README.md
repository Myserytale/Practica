- Door system with 3D animations
- Area transitions in 3D space

### ✅ Progression
- Collectible counting system
- Discovery/lore system
- Win condition when all artifacts collected
- Area unlocking based on progress

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Player Setup
- Create a Player GameObject (or use 3D Capsule) with:
  - PlayerController script
  - Either CharacterController OR Rigidbody (script supports both)
  - Collider (Box or Capsule)
  - Tag: "Player"

### 2. Camera Setup
- Add CameraFollow script to Main Camera
- Set target to Player transform
- Adjust offset for 3D perspective (e.g., 0, 5, -10)

### 3. GameManager Setup
- Create empty GameObject for GameManager
- Add GameManager script
- Connect UI elements (Canvas with Text components)

### 4. Collectibles
- Create 3D prefab (Sphere, custom mesh, etc.) with:
  - CollectibleItem script
  - Renderer with material
  - Collider (Is Trigger = true)
  - Tag: "Collectible"

### 5. Obstacles & Puzzles
- Doors: 3D model + Door script + Collider
- Pressure Plates: Flat 3D object + PressurePlate script + Trigger collider
- Movable Blocks: 3D Cube + MovableBlock3D script + Rigidbody
- Tag blocks as "Moveable"

## Art Requirements

### 3D Models/Primitives Needed:
- Player character (Capsule or custom model)
- Collectible crystals/artifacts (Spheres, custom meshes)
- Door models (Cubes, custom doors)
- Pressure plate (Flat cylinder)
- Movable block (Cube)
- Environment pieces (ProBuilder or terrain)

### Materials Needed:
- Player material
- Collectible crystal materials (glowing effect)
- Door materials (wood, metal, etc.)
- Pressure plate materials (stone, metal)
- Environment materials (grass, stone, etc.)

### Audio Needed:
- 3D Footstep sounds
- Collection sound effect
- Door opening sound
- Pressure plate activation
- Background ambient music (3D positioned)

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic 3D movement and jumping working first
2. **Use Primitives**: Use Unity's built-in 3D shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) for rapid prototyping
3. **Test Frequently**: Play test each feature as you add it in 3D space
4. **Keep Scope Small**: Focus on core 3D mechanics over complex features
5. **ProBuilder**: Use Unity's ProBuilder for quick 3D level design
6. **Lighting**: Set up basic lighting early - it makes 3D worlds feel more alive

## Potential Extensions (If Time Permits)

- Simple enemy AI with 3D pathfinding
- Health system with 3D UI
- More complex 3D puzzles
- Multiple levels/scenes
- Save/load system
- Achievement system
- 3D particle effects and post-processing

## Technical Notes

- Uses Unity's Input System (legacy) - works in 3D
- 3D physics-based movement with CharacterController or Rigidbody
- Supports both first-person and third-person perspectives
- Designed for 1920x1080 resolution
- All scripts are modular and reusable
- Ground checking system for proper jumping mechanics

## 3D Specific Considerations

- **Performance**: 3D generally requires more optimization than 2D
- **Lighting**: Proper lighting setup is crucial for 3D visibility
- **Navigation**: 3D spaces can be confusing - use landmarks and clear paths
- **Camera**: Consider camera collision and smooth following
- **Physics**: 3D physics can be more complex - test interactions thoroughly

Good luck with your 3D adventure game development!
